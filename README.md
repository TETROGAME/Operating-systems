## Overview

- Labs 1–5: C++ assignments focusing on OS concepts such as file I/O, multithreading, synchronization, and interprocess communication. Some labs provide variants for different C++ standards (e.g., “Lab 2 c++98” and “Lab 2 c++20”).
- Colloquium 1: C++ Industrial Programming
- Colloquium 2: A JWT-protected To‑Do List REST API built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis/RQ, and a small static frontend. See the dedicated README in that folder for features, setup, and Docker Compose instructions.

For details about each specific lab or project, open the corresponding folder. Where present, folder-level READMEs and build files provide exact requirements and run instructions.

## Notes

- Folder names indicate C++ standard variants where applicable (e.g., `c++98`, `c++20`).
- Tests, if present, are located within each lab/project directory.
- No license file is currently provided in the repository.
